# Arduino core files for MCUdude's cores
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MCUdude/MCUdude_corefiles.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MCUdude/MCUdude_corefiles)

This repo contains the Arduino corefiles used with [MightyCore](https://github.com/MCUdude/MightyCore), [MegaCore](https://github.com/MCUdude/MegaCore), [MiniCore](https://github.com/MCUdude/MiniCore) and [MajorCore](https://github.com/MCUdude/MightyCore).

## Supported clock frequencies
By supported I mean clocks that accurate timing is implemented for (millis, micros, delay, delayMicroseconds).
* 32 MHz
* 24 MHz
* 20 MHz
* 18.432 MHz
* 16 MHz
* 14.7456 MHz
* 12 MHz
* 11.0592 MHz
* 8 MHz
* 7.3728 MHz
* 4 MHz
* 3.6864 MHz
* 2 MHz
* 1.8432 MHz
* 1 MHz

### Exactness of `delayMicroseconds()`

The `delayMicroseconds(unsigned int us)` implementation is exact up to a few
cycles.

The maximum input parameter to work reliably is 10000 for 10 milliseconds.

For 24 MHz and above, calling it with an argument of 0 is *not* well defined.
